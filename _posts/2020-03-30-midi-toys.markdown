[description] During lockdown I have been putting Arduinos in boxes and connecting them to MIDI to provide various musical utility. Arduino can act as a synth or a sampler (I did two Arduino-only EPs last year) but it really shines as a MIDI insert and passthrough effect. I think I overused 'the one-note-triggered harp-like chords' effect on my last two EPs. It's too easy, sounds very pretty.
