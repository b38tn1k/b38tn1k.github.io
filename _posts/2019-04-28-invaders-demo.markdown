Tomohiro Nishikado's work on Space Invaders is incredible. I was listening to the AJJ song 'Personal Space Invaders' and realised layering symmetrical arrays of random noise + sine functions might create something sorta in a similar vibe to the Space Invaders characters. The generated sprites def do not have the character or attitude of the original hand drawn character designs, some of them just look like blobs. but it's just a tribute
