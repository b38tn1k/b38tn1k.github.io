[description]This is a weird one.

I am thinking about Miro + Scratch.io squished together; an infinite scrolling canvas for making small software processes. Drag and drop blocks to make functions and/or arrays, then run your process in the browser! This is an ongoing project with a couple UI and logic bugs on the TODO list. A basic [Turing Machine bit flip program](https://b38tn1k.com/WIP/#demo14) demonstrates current status.

### Example Scripts
- [Hello World](https://b38tn1k.com/WIP/#demo0)
- [Blocks](https://b38tn1k.com/WIP/#demo1)
- [Assigning](https://b38tn1k.com/WIP/#demo2)
- [Basic Math](https://b38tn1k.com/WIP/#demo3)
- [Comparisons & Function Mutation](https://b38tn1k.com/WIP/#demo4)
- [If](https://b38tn1k.com/WIP/#demo5)
- [If & Not](https://b38tn1k.com/WIP/#demo6)
- [Drawing Polygons](https://b38tn1k.com/WIP/#demo8)
- [Array Basics & While](https://b38tn1k.com/WIP/#demo9)
