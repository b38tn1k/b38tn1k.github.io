I just wanted to compare two mixes (new b38tn1k music coming). But sometimes procrastinating with some technical thinking can help restore the creative decision making bits of the brain, so I made this while waiting for CyberTruck launch (!!!)

load two songs (probably different mixes of the same song) and then you can A/B over and over.. you can scrub and stuff. It is buggy but it works good enough.
