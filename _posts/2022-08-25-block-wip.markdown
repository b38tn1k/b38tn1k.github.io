[description]<strong>I am still building on this and will try to indicate which parts work.</strong> This is a weird one.

I am thinking about Miro + Scratch.io squished together; an infinite scrolling canvas for writing scripts. Drag and drop blocks to make functions etc.

Update Aug 31: [A quick demo video](https://youtu.be/raH8681pZL4) and a live [demo](https://b38tn1k.com/WIP/#demo3) of the math instruction set. [description]
