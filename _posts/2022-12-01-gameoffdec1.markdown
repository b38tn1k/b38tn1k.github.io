The Game Off 2022 submission window has closed and voting is now open! I've checked out a few games already. A lot of Unity based games.

Two games I have really liked so far are Don't! Spill the Beans and An Original Fairytale.

[Don't! Spill the Beans](https://fyshstyx.itch.io/dont-spill-the-beans) is a simple but challenging memory / bean tracking game where you have to click on beans and their intended target. The beans come faster and faster and keeping up get really challenging. A few small glitches but a really cool idea.

[An Original Fairytale](https://doughnxt.itch.io/an-original-fairytale) leans into the Game Off theme of 'cliche' with a knight on a mission to rescue a princess from a castle, platform jumping through a forest of obstacles. The gameplay is extremely well done - it's amazing that it was made in a month. The art is wonderful too and the dev has included a bunch of secret hidden rooms that make exploring the 2D world a lot of fun.
