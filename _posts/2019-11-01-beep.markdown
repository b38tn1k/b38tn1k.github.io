I wasn't that happy with the usefulness of the [PCM MIDI Sample Player](https://b38tn1k.com/arduino/2019/10/31/PCM-sampler/) so I started looking for other projects I could use the circuit and case for.

Ended up with a bass-y acidic monosynth.

This Arduino based synth uses a granular synthesis sketch by [Peter Knight](https://code.google.com/archive/p/tinkerit/wikis/Auduino.wiki). I made a couple minor changes:

- MIDI in
- The case I wanted to use from the PCM Sample Player had only 3 pots so I messed with the code to make them useful
- the switch turns on a glide mode

It sounds cooler than the sampler, is still a bit of a one trick horse but I will probably use this more.
