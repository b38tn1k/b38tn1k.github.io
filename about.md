My name is James and this is my website. I am an Aussie engineer/hacker/maker/nerd who studied Mechatronic Engineering at UNSW, Sydney. I now live in in Oakland, California.


I play guitar in Sydney based garage/grunge/indie/fuzz/pop band [Royal Chant](http://royalchant.bandcamp.com/). I am interested in robots and the Internet of Things, creative code and hacking, Ableton Live, hiking, pizza, learning new things and both listening to and making all sorts of music.


In previous day jobs I have done thermal analysis on fibre optic network nodes for Australia's National Broadband Network, helped develop an [electronic musical instrument](http://petervogelinstruments.com.au/) now used by artists like Stevie Wonder and Deadmau5, and helped create 360 Video content for [Tourism Australia's international 2016 campaign](http://www.australia.com/en-us/things-to-do/aquatic.html).
