[description]A little client run neural net that is very un-useful. Still jamming on it so features may change. Running a convolutional neural network in a browser might lock up your browser if you have many tabs open. Proceed with caution :-P <small>(it runs ok in Chrome on a 2015 Mac Air with a couple extra tabs, just be cautious)</small>[description]
