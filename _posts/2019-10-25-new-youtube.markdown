I made a Youtube channel so I could share that [chordtoy]({{ site.url }}/arduino/2019/10/24/chordtoy/) video. So I decided to upload some animations and things I had made with Processing and P5.js (like the toys on the homepage) with music from that EP w01f I did. they are too repetative and boring to be filmclips. I am thinking of them as lyric videos for instrumental songs :-P

I have a couple more Arduino-y projects in the works so hopefully new videos etc soon :-)

Here are some videos:
