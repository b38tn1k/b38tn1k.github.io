# Sigma Plant

## TODO:

- [ ] Zone should have knowledge of contained features:
  - [ ] group moving
  - [ ] duplication
  - [ ] station list

- [ ] Processes can have 'sub process' which are actually 'Sub Plants'
  - to show sub processes need a level naviagation widget as above 
  - sub process plants need special Source / Sink zones for the input and output of the higher level process
  - 'add sub process' on station block

- [ ] Inputs and Outputs should be addable components to subprocesse
  - Tags for Material / Informational /  Energy / Mechanical / Custom
  - Created by adding sources or sinks in the process, consider the Station block above as now having multiple ins/outs (update to match + tags)

- [ ] Split Block with Percentages (two way only, slider split maybe)
  - Handle multiple outputs (on Connector side?)

- [ ] Delay / Duration Block 

- [ ] Feature Tagging:
  - Value Add
  - No-Value Add
  - Mandated Necessary
  - Waste
  - Rework
  - Handoff

- [ ] Map and time between any Source and Sink

- [ ] Mobile touch input


### Requires Server
