Rankings are in and November Man and Possum came 146th out of 554 entries! Pretty decent for a first timer. I am excited to enter again next year and try crack the top 25% next time (I was so close). Overall rankings are shown below, I really failed to adhere to the theme of the Game Jam, 'cliche'. but everything else was pretty consistent!
