The warehouse looked like all the others. A broken asphalt driveway punctuated by muddy puddles. Rusted barbed wire tangled around a partially collapsed fence. The gate hung open, moving silently in the slight breeze. A power transformer set hard against the building appeared to be the only recent addition.<br><br>A wide and angular-shaped vehicle entered the lot, ignoring the potholes and navigating towards the small front door. The vehicle's bare steel carapace reflected the sunlight such that it was difficult to look directly at it. The vehicle stopped and a single well-dressed passenger disembarked.<br><br>She was met at the front door by a less-than-well-dressed and slightly overweight man who appeared both nervous and excited.<br><br>"You've made it! Sometimes the maps take people the wrong way"<br><br>They entered the building and arrived in a large room populated with server towers, each tower connected by claustrophobically low networking conduits that carried yellow and blue ribbons up and down the aisles. It was noticeably warmer compared to outside.<br><br>"We've been here around 2 years now. I started this project back in the share house but some of my roommates started complaining about the power bill so I moved out and got this place. The system is already up but it takes a minute or two for the render engine to power on. Once it's ready I can show you around inside. What you see here is what we built with the seed funding. We run the sim during work hours and switch over to crypto mining when we are out. Gotta pay the bills somehow"<br><br>The man motioned to a desk with two worn office chairs, a laptop, and a pair of Virtual Reality headsets.<br><br>"I find it easier to navigate the space this way. We can render anything, follow subjects, and pretty much model any behavior, it's our own private universe!"<br><br>Inside the headset was pitch black.<br><br>"It's pretty boring at the start. Before we just put in a random seed and then we had to fast-forward the sim to verify. If we got something we liked we would add it to the list. We have been getting closer and closer to a perfect model. Let's try this one"<br><br>In the headset, a speck of light at the center of the view exploded into white, then the white decayed into speckled noise.<br><br>"So I'll keep it running fast but let's zoom in there"<br><br>A pale yellow dot in the top left grew to fill the view.<br><br>"You ok? Some people get a bit dizzy at this scale."<br><br>"Ok, we are now in real-time"<br><br>A familiar blue dot came into view.<br><br>Earth<br><br>Closer<br><br>North America<br><br>Closer<br><br>West Coast<br><br>Closer<br><br>Bay Area<br><br>Closer<br><br>
