Kicking it off with something extremely booooring. I am thinking about architecture and drawing pictures / flow diagrams. Mobile vs Desktop have different input methods and serving both is always tricky. For this project I want to make it nice and sensible from the start. Rendering has similar challenges, the local vs global coords method I implemented in UBT can be improved upon. I'm also probably going to go over the top with atomic .js scripts, the monolithic 'functions.js' approach is lazy first, difficult later.
