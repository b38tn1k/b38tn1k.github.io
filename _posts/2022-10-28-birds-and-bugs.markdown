Some bug squishing today! I fixed some input conflicts that made the player character travel at very high speed. I think I may have figured out the mobile device audio streaming issue - more testing still required.

I also added chickens. They don't do anything but I like chickens (I have 9 IRL).

The [soundtrack](https://b38tn1k.bandcamp.com/album/november-man-and-possum-ost) is live on Bandcamp, only one of the two tracks is in the game - trying to fade in/out audio files seems like it is too difficult for WebAudio, at least on Safari: a lot of zipper noise and popping and distortion, which is a shame. The second track was only intended to play in the Northern Temple, it has a bit of a darker feel and some robotic sounding drums. The tracks were made on Ableton with soft and hardware synths, my mixing desk is broken at the moment so more soft-synths than usual. The tracks are named for, and inspired by, different dragon-fly type insects that visit my backyard in Summer: Green Darners and Meadowhawks.

## Later:
I uploaded and entered the game into the Itch & GitHub 'Game Off' game jam. Excited to see if anyone plays it. Many of last year's Game Off entries are super imaginative and really impressive; this was my first game so I just appreciated being able to work towards a goal. I think I can still make bug fixes and re-upload changes prior to the end date.

I had to create some screenshots for the Itch submission.
