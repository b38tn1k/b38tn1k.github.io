*I recently graduated from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia with a Bachelor in Mechatronic Engineering. I have 7 years experience working at various technical levels in engineering companies including 2 years experience working in research and development for the creative industry. This involved electronic, mechanical, and software design.*

## Work Experience
**Applied Technologist, [Finch Company](https://www.finchcompany.com/)**

*Sydney, Australia — November 2013 to December 2015*

I was responsible for research, development, and technical management of numerous projects spanning electronic, mechanical, and software engineering within small (2-4 person) development teams. In addition to my involvement in prototype development, I corresponded with large scale manufacturers in Australia and China to fulfill the mass-production requirements of projects. All projects required communication and collaboration with non-technical clientele. During my time at Finch, I provided IT support for the Sydney office and maintained hardware within the workshop.

**Junior Researcher and Developer, [Peter Vogel Instruments / Fairlight](http://petervogelinstruments.com.au/)**

*Sydney, Australia — April 2012 to November 2013*

Focusing on the development of a digital sampling musical instrument, the [Fairlight CMI30A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairlight_CMI), I performed digital circuit design for the user interface, circuit translation for FPGA development, and creative development of the default sound library. This project was very special to me as it combined my passions for both engineering and music. In 2015, the sounds of the Fairlight CMI were added to the Australian National Film and Sound Archive.

**Intern, Cetnaj Pty Ltd & Just Technology Pty Ltd**

*Sydney, Australia — August 2009 to April 2012*

Working with the same engineering team across two companies, I performed thermodynamic analysis of fibre optic server cabinets and assisted in the construction of said cabinets. My thermodynamic analysis culminated in a report I authored on passive cooling, which was provided to clients and potential customers.

## Skills
Working in applied technology required me to understand and apply new concepts quickly to meet strict deadlines. My strong relationship with many non-technical clients and creatives was determined by my communication skills and ability to clearly explain the research, feasibility, design, and manufacturing processes for each project.

Projects I have worked on have covered various areas of technology, including:


- Hardware manufacturing and material designs: CNC and laser fabrication, material design, pick and place manufacture and prototyping for mass-production, 3D printing.
- The development of connected (IoT) devices for gesture recognition and bioinformatics: circuit design, embedded software, app development, and API development.
- Computer vision, virtual reality, augmented reality, and 360 camera design: app development, 3D printing and camera structure design, data and stitching automation, camera- assist, and UAV pilot.

During my time at university, I undertook robotics and control theory courses in which I created MATLAB based solutions for various common robotics problems:


- Extender Kalman Filter for control of velocity, orientation, and localization using data recorded from a rover.
- Computer vision for pick-and-place robotic arm control. This included object recognition and control of an ABB 6 axes robot to avoid singularities.
- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping using data recorded from a SICK laser scanner.

My project driven experience, coupled with my studies, has provided me with a strong fundamental understanding of mechanical, electrical, manufacturing, and software engineering. I believe communication and organization to be important factors in ensuring a project is completed successfully within the required timeframe.

## Software
I am a proficient Python programmer and regularly program in Lua. I have academic and project-focused experience using C++, Matlab, RobotStudio, Java, C#, Verilog, objC, and Swift. 


I use git version control on all software projects. I regularly use Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Atmel AVR products. I have project experience with Texas Instruments and Nordic devices, focusing on Low Energy Bluetooth development.


Some of my favorite software includes git, vim, SolidWorks, Pro/Engineer, Eagle, ABB RobotStudio, Unity, Ableton Live, Android Studio, and Xcode. 


I have experience with VMware and vSphere, having provided IT support to an office of ~30 employees in an industry that generates a large amount of data.


I am comfortable on all major operating systems and office suites.

## Education
University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia - Bachelor of Mechatronic Engineering, 2016.


Final Year Thesis Project: PID Control over the Internet (Cloud Robotics)


## Publications
Kieren Lim, James Robert Carthew, Luke Richard Savy, Jayantha Katupitiya, Ka Ching Chan, and Mary Martin *Development of a Cloud Robotic Testbed for IT Capstone Projects* 05 July 2014 [http://www.icita.org/2014/papers/au-chan.pdf](http://www.icita.org/2014/papers/au-chan.pdf)

I contributed research on IoT and provided argument for the inclusion of Cloud Robotics in the IoT family (Sections II and III)

## Personal Information
Prior to moving to Sydney to study I worked as a checkout operator in rural Australia. During my time at university, I supported myself by working at a nightclub and a men’s wear store. I believe these early work experiences provided me with a strong work ethic.
As a musician, I have organized and performed on national tours of Australia and the United States with my group Royal Chant. Since moving to Oakland, I have been lucky enough to meet some inspiring musicians and have already started a new band.
Photography, hiking, rock climbing and camping keep me in touch with nature and provide a necessary balance to my life.
