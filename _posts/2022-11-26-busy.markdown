It gets busy this time of year! I fixed a couple typos on Thanksgiving but didn't progress much further. Yesterday I added a new StickySprite class (quicksand puddles etc) to increase the 'narrative bond' between November Man and Possum. November Man gets stuck, Possum saves him.

I also worked on getting the soundtrack up and running with mixed results:
- It works perfect on Chrome,
- It doesn’t work at all on iOS safari or mobile chrome.
- It occasionally glitches on Safari.
- I should install Mozilla.

The only suggested fix I’ve found online is to roll back p5.js to a very old version (I'm on 1.5, need ~0.4). This loses all the WebGL shader stuff. Sorta frustrating, I will continue searching for a solution.

Still working out the final level dialog, attempting to avoid too many words on the screen and overly complex dialog trees... will figure it out today hopefully.
