Drones eat batteries like crazy. Repetitive drone usage means changing batteries often. This is like micro-last-mile. If I can get the drone as close as possible to the drop off point before it needs to use batteries, I can delay changing batteries.

Also, launching small drones from large drones is really fun! [Full patent here.](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11106224B2/)
