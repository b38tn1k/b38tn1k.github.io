A bunch of levels today, focusing on the main story beats of the game. I also cleaned up the level building script to break out some helper methods that kept turning up in level creation.

When I kicked off this project I didn't know how far I would be able to get in a month but, if I had something half alright, I wanted to enter it in the Github November Game Jam competition. I think I will have enough by the end of November to give it a try! Hooray.

I still have a couple TODOs but i think they are achievable:
- make some of the animations cleaner.
- add the soundtrack (already recorded)
- make randomHuman() have a couple different sprite options to chose from.
- finish up the final level.
- and probably some I can't think of right now.
