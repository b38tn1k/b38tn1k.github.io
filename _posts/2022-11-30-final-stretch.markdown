It is the last day of November! I shared the game out to a couple friends and they found more bugs and typos. I fixed most of them and I kept one: the player character moves faster when controlled by WASD to travel diagonally. It's fixable but I think it is sorta funny. And Minecraft carts do it too, so it's probably ok.

Other than that, I think the game is good to go!
