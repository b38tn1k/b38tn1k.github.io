There are some drone firmwares that are common (I'm a fan of PX4 and the whole Auterion ecosystem) but there isn't really any 'industry standard', *at least not yet*.

So we made a drone box that could be reconfigured to hold different shapes of multicopters and hold them down until they tried to take off. FFT on an audio stream from a microphone is a super effective way to ID a different drone; they all spin a bit different, have different 'beeps' and prop/motor noises that the code could pick up and differentiate, even in high noise environments! Some really cool prototypes in this project. [Full patent here.](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11214367B2/)
