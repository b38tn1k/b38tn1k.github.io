The recent Ableton Live update (9.2) provided an extension to the Ableton Push MIDI Controller operating on Drum Rack mode. This update allows for all 64 pads to be used as a drum rack. This performance mode was accompanied by an excellent set of sounds and instruments by controllerist [Mad Zach][madzach]. I've always been interested in controllerism and these sound packs are a lot of fun.

I am interested in the performance tradition of instruments and their evolution. More "modern" instruments such as the bass guitar, synthesizers and samplers (including the MPC and descendants) have a much shorter playing history and thus less consensus on the optimal performer-instrument interaction techniques when compared to the established traditions of orchestral instruments. The synthesizer (east coast definition) inherits and extends the performance techniques of more established instruments, the most common being the keyboard (exceptions exist in Wiard, Buchla, Serge, et al). The bass guitar inherits techniques from traditional string instruments with vast improvements being championed by players such as Stanley Clark, Jaco Pastorius and many others...

The Linn 9000 established an instrument format that exists between a percussive instrument and a keyboard instrument with obvious performance techniques inherited from both traditions. The Akai MPC60 perfected the arrangement of the performance pads, providing an expressive instrument and establishing a performance tradition full of innovative players (look elsewhere for a list - I'm too scared to make one). MPC performance techniques have also been inherited from turntablism (another "modern instrument") and an improvisational approach to performance that originated in Jazz and Blues.

Considering the availability of excellent recordings and videos online, we are spoilt for choice with examples for study in the practice of controllerism. Contemporary notation methods in mpc tutorial videos are generally communicated aurally or diagrammatically. An example of this is the website [MPC Chord Finder][chordfinder]

A notation method for mpc performance could be implemented taking inspiration from guitar and drum tablature, and the dual stave of piano notation. A stave would provide a 'sample scale' indicating fingers across both hands with an alphanumeric Cartesian coordinate system allowing for identification of particular pads. This notation allows for the same notation method to be applied across a range of pad controller products without requiring anything more than extra coordinates. The notation reference system could also be accompanied with suggested sample types, which could be illustrated in a variety of formats:

Whilst the extended scale of the larger products increases the amount of samples available (and thus complexity of any subsequent notation), the notation method holds true across all formats. The 'sample scale' convention could be simplified and described in a variety of ways. Here I describe the sample layout for the AKAI MPC and Korg Nano Pad using two different table methods:
{% highlight null %}
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  a1 |  a2 |  b2 |  c1 |  c2 |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| BD1 | HH1 | HH2 | SN1 | SN2 |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

+---+----------+
| a | BD1, HH1 |
+---+----------+
| b |  2: HH2  |
+---+----------+
| c | SN1, SN2 |
+---+----------+
{% endhighlight %}
and for the LaunchPad and Push:
{% highlight null %}
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| a1  | c3  | d3  | e2  | e3  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| BD1 | HH2 | HH2 | SN1 | SN2 |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

+---+-------------+
| a |     BD1     |
+---+-------------+
| c |    3: HH1   |
+---+-------------+
| d |    3: HH2   |
+---+-------------+
| e | 2: SN1, SN2 |
+---+-------------+

Providing a scale/map such as this in addition to notation communicates preferences of sample placement, and allows for device independent notation. In any case, the sample scale can be replaced or modified by a player to reflect their personal preferences.

Using a left hand / right hand tabulature stave with sample names as the event indicator provides a method to notate sample pad based performance:

{% highlight null %}
Right Hand        1    &    2    &    3    &    4    &
Ring Finger:    |---------------------SN1-----------------|
Middle Finger:  |------HH2-----------------HH2-------HH2--|
Index Finger:   |-----------HH1-----------------HH1-------|
Thumb:          |-BD1------------BD1----------------------|
Left Hand         1    &    2    &    3    &    4    &
Thumb:          |-----------------------------------------|
Index Finger:   |-----------------------------------------|
Middle Finger:  |-----------------------------------------|
Ring Finger:    |-----------------------------------------|
{% endhighlight %}
The above notation represents a simple 4/4 shuffle/hip hop beat using only the right hand. The notation should look familiar for anyone who has ever read music notation, tablature or piano roll. This particular beat could be performed many other ways, using both hands or different fingers on the right hand. This example is just the way that I play that beat. I decided to keep the thumbs towards the centre of the stave to assist with sight reading as I utilize the thumb and inner fingers more often compared with the outer fingers. The majority of notes in a notated piece should primarily exist closer the the centre of the stave. It is very easy to extend the stave to account for the pinky finger although, through practice I have found my usage of the pinky to be minimal (I will use my pinky if I can't reach a pad as quick with my ring finger).

Alternatively, a coordinate notation of the above beat could look like this:
{% highlight null %}
Right Hand        1    &    2    &    3    &    4    &
Ring Finger:    |---------------------c1------------------|
Middle Finger:  |------b2------------------b2--------b2---|
Index Finger:   |-----------a2------------------a2--------|
Thumb:          |-a1-------------a1-----------------------|
Left Hand         1    &    2    &    3    &    4    &
Thumb:          |-----------------------------------------|
Index Finger:   |-----------------------------------------|
Middle Finger:  |-----------------------------------------|
Ring Finger:    |-----------------------------------------|
{% endhighlight %}
The coordinate based notation method reduces the flexibility of the notation system but may prove useful for instruction purposes or any scenario in which the sample layout is predetermined.

The above notation techniques indicate purely performance preferences in terms of sample placement and finger utilization. The notation system could be extended to include additional stylistic details such as velocity (low -, mid +, high *), crabbing (^) and (if available) aftertouch (~ for pulse, = for hold, / for increase pressure, \ for decrease pressure). A more expressive two bar sequence may look something like this:
{% highlight null %}
+---+---------------------+
| a |    BD1, 4: CHORD1   |
+---+---------------------+
| b | BD2, HH1, 4: CHORD2 |
+---+---------------------+
| c |  2: HH2, 4: CHORD3  |
+---+---------------------+
| d |       SN1, SN2      |
+---+---------------------+

+-----+--------+-----+-----+--------+-----+--------+-----+-----+
|  a1 |   a4   |  b1 |  b2 |   b4   |  c2 |   c4   |  d1 |  d2 |
+-----+--------+-----+-----+--------+-----+--------+-----+-----+
| BD1 | CHORD1 | BD2 | HH1 | CHORD2 | HH2 | CHORD3 | SN1 | SN2 |
+-----+--------+-----+-----+--------+-----+--------+-----+-----+

Right Hand        1    &    2    &    3    &    4    &      1    &    2    &    3    &    4    &
Ring Finger:    |--------------------*SN1-----------------|-----+SN2-----------*SN2-----------------|

Left Hand         1    &    2    &    3    &    4    &      1    &    2    &    3    &    4    &

The basic nature of sample pad instruments reduces the requirement for a written notation form as any composition can just as easily be recorded onto the device for future reference. The benefit of a written notation system is the ability to communicate stylistic and performance concepts not explicitly stored in a recording. Hopefully this notation system provides a method for discussion of Controllerism techniques and practices. Any notation system allows for sharing of knowledge in a written form. I started a little javascript (not my forte) helper to assist with notation. It is called [Tab 4 Pads][tabs4pads] and I will post more when it is done...
