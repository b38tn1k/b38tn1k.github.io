Yesterday I made a Youtube channel so I could share that [chordtoy]({{ site.url }}/arduino/2019/10/24/chordtoy/) video.

Today I decided to upload some other animations and things I have made with Processing and P5.js (like the toys on the homepage). And I paired these animations with music from my EP w01f. They are too repetative to be filmclips so I am thinking of them as lyric videos for instrumental songs :-P

I have a couple more Arduino-y projects in the works so hopefully new videos etc soon :-)

Here are some videos:
