[description] During lockdown I have been putting Arduinos in boxes and connecting them to MIDI to provide various musical utility.

Arduino can act as a synth or a sampler (I [did](https://b38tn1k.com/#discog/music-for-arduino-algorithmic-suite-for-uno-quartet) [two](https://b38tn1k.com/#discog/music-for-arduino-escape-from-dinosaur-island) Arduino-only EPs last year) but it really shines as a MIDI insert and passthrough effect.

I think I overused 'the one-note-triggered harp-like chords' effect on my last [two](https://b38tn1k.com/#discog/new-desk) [EPs](https://b38tn1k.com/#discog/z). It's too easy, sounds very pretty.
