[description] During lockdown I have been putting Arduinos in boxes and connecting them to MIDI to provide various musical utility.



Arduino can act as a synth or a sampler (I <a href="https://b38tn1k.com/#discog/music-for-arduino-algorithmic-suite-for-uno-quartet" target="_blank" >did</a> <a href="https://b38tn1k.com/#discog/music-for-arduino-escape-from-dinosaur-island" target="_blank" >two</a> Arduino-only EPs last year) but it really shines as a MIDI insert and passthrough effect.

I think I overused 'the one-note-triggered harp-like chords' effect on my last <a href="https://b38tn1k.com/#discog/new-desk" target="_blank" >two</a> <a href="https://b38tn1k.com/#discog/z" target="_blank" >EPs</a>. It's too easy, sounds very pretty.
