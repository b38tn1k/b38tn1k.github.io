I had the chance to remix a track off an old friend's new sci-fi electronic album:

Cassie and I were in Baja and had spent the morning driving ATVs over bumpy roads. The remix was done outside, on the beach just north of Ensenada with laptop speakers only. The original track Free is gentle and epic, I wanted to make it fast and claustrophobic, sort of touching footwork/juke sound but without any real understanding of it. Here it is:

Also, Mark from Royal Chant did a collab with Andrew after I made introductions. It's pretty cool too:
